# Run `bench new-app`

This will walk you through the creation of a new app.

_Note: this is an upstream `bench` command and not yet seamlessly integrated with Frappix._

# Add the production pin for your new sources

_Note: this is dumped from memory after the fact, expect imprecision._

- Go to `apps/_pins/config.toml`
- Declare your new source; take examples from the Frappix repository
- Run `nvchecker -c config.toml` to pin the sources and generate the files

Note: you may have seen `<app>.passthru` arguments in the Frappix repository's `config.toml`

- `since` declares how far the shallow clone should go back (acquiring a common ancestor if since isn't in the parent tree of the current branch)
- `upstream` declares a fetch configuration to only fetch the portions of history from upstream that you may be interested in

These setups are done on first clone, so they don't have any effect on your newly created app, since you already initialized the repository locally.

# Add `./apps/<my-app>.nix`

Change the name of the file to the name of your app and paste the following content and go through the comments:

```nix
{
  # access to the pinned frappix sources
  appSources,
  # helper function to extract metadata from frappe apps
  extractFrappeMeta,
  # access to a nixpkgs library
  lib,
  # python builder instrumentation
  buildPythonPackage,
  pythonRelaxDepsHook,
  flit-core,
  python,
}:
buildPythonPackage rec {
  inherit
    (extractFrappeMeta src)
    pname
    version
    format
    ;

  # change to access your app's sources
  inherit (appSources.my-app) src;
  # change for a rudimentary `import my-app`-like assertion
  # of the final package as if run from a python repl
  pythonImportsCheck = ["my-app"];

  nativeBuildInputs = [
    # this tool helps to relax dependencies in case the prepackages libraries
    # are of a different version; prepackages libraries have the huge benefit
    # of being readily available and cached and most of the time work just fine
    pythonRelaxDepsHook
    # the upstream app template uses flit-core these days
    # for older packages, you best update the build system and upstream your patch
    flit-core
  ];

  # additional python or other dependencies
  # for all available packages, see: https://search.nixos.org/packages
  propagatedBuildInputs = with python.pkgs; [
    # rembg
  ];

  # typically, we want to simply relax all dependency versions and use the prepackaged ones;
  # if a version does _really_ not work, you'll need to package the correct python package
  # yourself; for that: get help in the Matrix Chat!
  pythonRelaxDeps = true;
}
```

<div class="warning">
Because Nix is designed to only load files which are principally under version controll,
you'll at least to <code>git add ./apps/\<my-app\>.nix</code> before it will be visible to the builder.
</div>

# Add it to `./apps/pkgs.nix`

Add your new package to `./apps/pkgs.nix`, change and uncomment the part about the custom app.

```nix
  inject = _: prev: {
    # extend the frappix package set
    frappix = prev.frappix.overrideScope (finalFrappix: prevFrappix: {
      # inject your pinned sources (if any) into the frappix build pipeline
      appSources = prevFrappix.appSources.overrideScope (_: _: _pins);
      # add custom apps that are not yet packaged by frappix
      # my-app = finalFrappix.callPackage ./my-app.nix {};
    });
  };
```

`pkgs.frappix` is now populated with your new app.

It is now available for ubiquitous use under that handle in deployment artifacts, development environments, etc.

# Add it to `./tools/shells.nix`

Chose the right name from the previous step and uncomment where it reads:

```nix
      bench.apps = with pkgs.frappix; [
        # my-app
      ];
```

# Finally `direnv reload`

This ensures that `apps.txt` will be updated.

TODO: make this part of automatism.

# Configure `fjsd`

To obtain semantic diff on Frapp√© JSON, within the git repository of your new app, run:

```console
git config --local --add diff.fsjd.command "fsjd --git"
cat << CONFIG >> .git/info/attributes
*.json diff=fsjd
CONFIG
```
